0.1.21 2nd Oct 2018
= Fixed XInput Dpad right / down swapped

0.1.20 7th Sep 2018
+ Added XInput support
  Does not have Bind Mode, as normal AHK hotkeys would see the input too
+ Added Support for Nintendo Switch to Titan
+ Performance increases for Mouse Delta input:
  Cache state of Invert checkboxes in MouseToJoy plugin 
  Disable pseudo-thread callback for mouse delta
+ Replaced CreateGUID  with Lexikos' ANSI compatible version

0.1.19 26th Dec 2017
+ Added Deadzone option to axis splitter

0.1.18 - 27th Oct 2017
= Increased number of Titan One axes to 13
  TouchX and TouchY are now selectable.
+ Axis Splitter now has invert options for output axes
+ Added second editbox to CodeRunner plugin for code to run on button release

0.1.17 - 21st Aug 2017
= You can now properly bind Mouse Wheel
= "Profile Inherits from Parent" checkbox now correctly updates when switching profile
+ Scale added to AxisToMouse, as sensitivity is a curve
+ The PauseButton plugin now beeps when you pause / unpause
+ Titan One D-Pad now correctly set
+ Titan One PS3 controllers now support accelerometer
+ Titan One PS4 controllers now support gyros

0.1.16 - 11th Jun 2017
= Revert out: Changed Associative array empty detection technique to Lexikos' one
  Seems to break vJoy bindings on reload.

0.1.15 - 6th Jun 2017
+ Added AxisRangeToButtons plugin
  This can be used to map an axis to up to 10 buttons.
  eg for throttle operated by up to 10 keyboard keys
+ Added AxesToMouse plugin
  Joystick to mouse
+ Added ButtonInitializer plugin
+ Adds Notes plugin
  Useful if you send someone an INI - you can write instructions in here.
= Fixed previews in AxisMerger plugin
= Crash fix in InputDelta plugin
+ Adds Loading splash screen
+ Fixed warning in ProfileSwitcher plugin
  When you first tried to select a target profile, you would get a warning
  that the clear item already existed.
= Added #NoEnv to all threads for performance
= Changed Associative array empty detection technique to Lexikos' one

0.1.14 - 12th Mar 2017
= Massive changes to the MouseToButtons plugin
  Is now a lot less "flickery"
  There is now a "State Change" timeout value
  This controls how long it takes to change state (reduce flicker)
= The MouseToJoy relative mode timeout value now works for the y axis

0.1.13 - 12th Mar 2017
+ Added Mouse Delta to Buttons plugin
+ Fixed suggested name for new plugins
+ Multiple InputAxis controls can now be bound to the same axis
+ Set default SetKeyDelay value to 0, 0
  UCR does not send keypresses, it maps down events to down events etc
  So this would likely only slow the code down

0.1.12 - 7th Mar 2017
+ Added AxisRangeToButtons plugin
  This allows you to map an axis to up to 10 buttons
  Each button has a "Low" and "High" value. If the axis is in this range...
  Then the button is pressed. Else it is released.
  If you need more buttons, more can be added by editing the source code.
+ You can now duplicate profiles using the "Copy" button in the toolbox.
  Code contributed by Snoothy - thankyou!
+ You can now rename plugins to the same name but with different case
+ IOControl menus are now initialized when first opened.
  This will mainly benefit users with large numbers of profiles.
  UCR should load quicker, and you should not get a "Too many menus" error.
  Code contributed by Snoothy - thankyou!
+ MaxThreads setting cranked up to 255
  This seems to alleviate issues with fast, simultaneous input.
+ The InputDelta now self-updates Seen Mice

0.1.11 - 19th Feb 2017
+ You can now rename plugins
+ You can now re-order plugins
+ Plugin close button is now an icon
+ There are now preview GuiControls for Buttons and Axes
  You no longer have to code your own in plugins
  The Axis preview remains as a slider
  The Button preview comes in two flavors:
  A regular 25x25 icon with on/off states
  A 3x34 icon that sits right next to an IOControl (To save horizontal space)
+ Added support for the following PS4 outputs on Titan One:
  TouchPad X+Y
  Aceelerometer X+Y
  Touch Button
= Renamed Playstation LS/RS to L3/R3 in Titan One
= Fixed bad calculations in ButtonsToAxis plugin for Low/High options
+ Added support for Command-Line profile switching via CLI.ahk
  Code contributed by Snoothy - thankyou!
+ You can now filter for individual mice in the MouseDelta
  Thanks to David Baldwin for contributing the bulk of the code.

0.1.10 - 4th Feb 2017
= Ultrastik devices now work with UCR
  Code contributed by Snoothy - thankyou!
= If vJoy is not installed, on startup you no longer get the error
  "Error. An item with the name vJoy already exists in this menu"

0.1.9 - 26th Dec 2016
= Fix for disconnected sticks causing massive CPU usage
  When a profile loads, it checks which sticks are connected.
  Bindings for disconnected sticks will not be activated.
  If you plug in the stick, try forcing a profile reload.
  An easy way is by switching to global profile and then back
 
0.1.8 - 16th Dec 2016
= Fix for "invalid Gui Name" error for BindModePrompt
  Hotkeys for bindmode were being enabled breifly on creation
= Fixed Joystick Hat/POV/D-Dpads in InputButtons
= Harmonized callback method for all input types to pseudo-threads

0.1.7 - 11th Dec 2016
= Fixed vJoy not acquring sticks until you changed a binding
* Merged Input-Output-Refactor into Master branch.

0.1.6 - 3rd Dec 2016
+ The ButtonsToAxis plugin now has settings for Low / Mid / High
  This enables remapping buttons to a "split axis" such as an XBox trigger.
  This change breaks the deflection setting of all existing ButtonsToAxis plugins.
  (Which is only an issue if you used non-standard settings)
  To fix this you can do a search and replace in your ini file:
  Find "Deflection" and replace with "DeflectionHigh"
= Reverted back to synchronous communication from main thread -> InputThreads
= When a profile's InputThread receives bindings upon loading, they are all passed in one call
  This massively reduces the number of inter-thread calls.

0.1.5 - 7th Nov 2016
! UCR.exe changed in this version.
  Some autopositioning bugs in AHK_H were found.
= Removed automatic saving of changes.
  This is suspected to be a trigger for some crashes or other undesirable behavior.
  It also meant that if something went wrong, the user had way of backing out of a change.
  So for now, it is gone. this may change in the future.
+ Added "Save Settings" button and readout to let you know if there are unsaved changes.
  There is also a warning if you try to exit UCR with unsaved changes.
= Fixed OutputButton getting stuck (Selecting options had no effect) if saved unbound.
= Improved code that handles the overall layout of the UCR GUI.
  Also added "Bottom Panel" to house the new save button.
  Thanks to HotkeyIt for implementing some fixes to our autopositioning system in AHK_H.
= Fixed Plugin ChangeValueCallbacks being fired multiple times with same value on start.
= Fixed Profile InputThreads being stopped then restarted when changing to current profile.
= Deleted profiles are now properly removed from UCR.ini

0.1.4 - 31st Oct 2016
+ Added "Pause" mode for UCR
  When UCR is Paused, all profiles (except the SuperGlobal profile) are DeActivated
  Useful, eg if you blocked Left Mouse Button in a profile and you need to use it.
+ Added new SuperGlobal profile
  Plugins in this profile will always be active, even when UCR is Paused
+ Added new "PauseButton" plugin
  Put this in the SuperGlobal profile, and use it to Pause UCR
+ Added "Incremental Mode" to the ButtonsToAxis plugin
  This adjusts the current axis position by the deflection setting on each press
  of the buttons. The axis does not center when you release a button in this mode.
= Titan Buttons now send a value of 100 to the Titan API, instead of 1.
  This fixes Titan one L2/R2 button mappings only deflecting the analog button 1%
= Fixed AxisInitializer plugin not working at all
= Fixed Titan triggers not sending correct values
= Fixed Titan PS3/4 triggers being absent from InputAxis
= Fix for GameBind in OutputAxis and OutputButton IOControls
= Changes to how settings are saved
  UCR now saves 30s after a change, rather than 1s.
  Profile's settings are now cached, so less work is done when we save.
= Re-Work of profile changing code
  Profile changes should now feel more responsive
= Profiles linked to by the Global profile are now always PreLoaded
  ie if you have a ProfileSwitcher plugin in the Global profile
  then the profile that it points to will always be PreLoaded (in memory)
= OutputAxis IOControls now clamp values to the 0..00 range

0.1.3 - 16th Oct 2016
+ Added a new AxisSplitter plugin.
  Useful eg for mapping a normal axis to two xbox triggers.
= IOControls got a standard width and height.
  Some plugins may look a little wonky until I can make a layout pass on them.
= The ButtonToAxis plugin is now called the ButtonsToAxis plugin
  It now remaps two InputButton controls to one OutputAxis control.
  It now also has a "Deflection %" setting to control how much it moves the axis
= The AxisToButton plugin is now called AxisToButtons
= The AxisMerge plugin is now called AxisMerger
= The menu entries in the main UCR menu for each IOClass now show properly on first start.
  You no longer have to add a Plugin to load vJoy / Titan APIs etc.
= Fixed checking of currently active output type in the Titan One API  
= Fixed saving of Standard GuiControl (editboxes etc) values
= XBox button / Playstation button now bindable as an output for Titan IOControls
= The Invert option in the MouseToJoy plugin now works in Absolute and Relative modes

0.1.2 - 11th Oct 2016
! Warning! this version is still a little clunky.
  IOClass options (eg to install SCPVBus) do not appear until you add a remapper plugin.
= Fix: vXBox Buttons can now be selected in the OutputButton control.
+ ScpVBus (Required for vXBox) now packaged with UCR.
  I will probably put in a download routine at some point
  But this will do as a stop-gap
+ ScpVBus can be installed / uninstalled from within UCR via the IOClasses > vJoy menu.

0.1.1 - 9th Oct 2016
+ Re-Added Titan One API

0.1.0 - 2nd Oct 2016
! WARNING! Lots of files changed, INI (Settings file) format changed!
  YOU ARE ADVISED TO BACK UP YOUR OLD UCR FOLDER AND MAKE A NEW ONE
! Major back-end changes. Things that worked before may well not work now.
  Please report issues on the forums or on the issue tracker on GitHub.com/evilC/UCR
! The Titan API has not been re-implemented in this release.
  It will follow. Please continue to use 0.0.x if you need Titan.
+ The vGen API now replaces the old vJoy API and allows vXBox as well as vJoy devices.
  vJoy 2.1.7 or greater is required, you can get it from here:
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/vjoystick/files/Beta%202.x/
! Also required for vGen is the SCPVBus driver, which can be found here:
  http://evilc.com/files/tmp/ScpVBus-x64.zip
  Download it, uncompress the ZIP, and open a command prompt as admin
  Run install.bat to add the driver, remove.bat to remove it
= Switch Absolute / Relative naming for MouseToJoy

0.0.18 - 16th Sept 2016
+ Added Console output via Titan One GCDAPI
  You can now output to consoles like you would output to vJoy.
  Hardware device (Titan One) required!

0.0.17 - 11th Sept 2016
+ There is now a "Main Menu" at the top of the UCR GUI.
  It has limited functionality for now, namely:
  * Minimize To Tray - Hides the Taskbar icon when UCR is minimized
  * Start Minimized - Minimizes UCR when it starts up.
  * Show Joystick Names - Attempts to get the names for your connected sticks.
     Trying to get joystick names was causing a crash for some users...
     ...so now it is optional and disabled by default.
     This option requires restarting UCR to take effect.
  * Show vJoy Log - Shows a log of the vJoy API loading process.
+ New menu system implemented for Bind Controls.
  It is now much quicker to select Inputs / Outputs, and easier for me to add new options.
+ Added AxisInitializer plugin.
  This can be used to initialize a virtual axis to a specified position.
  Whenever the profile containing the plugin activates, it will set the axis position.
+ All Input / Output GuiControls now have a GUID at run-time
  This GUID is currently not saved between runs, but it can be if needed.
  This allows plugins that subscribe to InputActivity to detect how many buttons are held.
= OneSwitch Pulse plugin fixes:
  The "Choice" InputButton has been removed, as any UCR input coulds as a Choice...
  ... so it served no useful purpose, and could cause problems...
  ... if it and a ButtonToButton in the same profile were both mapped to the same thing.
  Now correctly stops pulsing if a second button is pressed and released...
  ...while one button is held.
  Now correctly suspends pulsing for the <Choice Delay> time on joystick axis activity.

0.0.16 - 14th Aug 2016
+ The ButtonToButton plugin now has a Toggle mode
+ MouseToJoy plugin enhancements:
  Added Scale Factor to Absolute mode.
  Plugin can now be configured to only take input from a specific mouse.
  You can now use multiple MouseToJoy plugins if you have more than one pointing device.
+ Added "HoldButton" functionality to OneSwitch Pulse plugin.
= InputActivity subscriptions no longer fire if the plugin is not active.
  This only really affects OneSwitch Pulse or any custom plugins using InputActivity.
= Fixed bug that occurred when changing an InputButton plugin from button to hat:
  The old binding was remaining active, this is now fixed.
= Fixed bug that occurred when changing an InputButton from keyboard to vJoy:
  The vJoy selection UI would change selection of various elements in odd ways.
= A bunch of behind-the-scenes changes and fixes.
  Please let me know if stuff that used to work now doesn't.
= MouseToJoy plugin fixes:
  Fixed numerous bugs which made Absolute mode center the stick way too much.
  The Timeout value for Absolute mode now works.

0.0.15 - 24th July 2016
! All ProfileSwitcher plugins will no longer be bound to a profile.
  You are advised to delete and re-add the plugin.
+ Dialogs to choose name of new Profile / Plugin now appear in the center of the UCR GUI.
+ A new custom GuiControl - the ProfileSelect is now available for Plugin Authors to use.
  This allows you to provide a guicontrol for users to choose a profile.
+ There is now a Text-To-Speech library provided in UCR.Libraries.TTS
+ Added Profile Speaker plugin.
  This can be used to speak something when a profile becomes active.
+ The OneSwitch Pulse plugin now makes a beep on toggle on/off.
+ The OneSwitch Pulse plugin now has a "Timeout Warning" setting.
= The recommended development environment for UCR is now AHK Studio
  Debugging of UCR and it's plugins is now much simpler.
  See the UCR wiki for info on debugging plugins.
  The code is now also split out into one file per class, so should be easier to work with.
= When you enter Bind Mode, the OnInActive() method is now called on all active plugins.
  All plugins should cease all activity on OnInActive() and resume on OnActive()
= The code of the ProfileSwitcher plugin is now vastly simplified.
  Most of it's code was moved into the ProfileSelect GuiControl.

0.0.14 - 19th June 2016
! INI (Settings) file format changed to 0.0.5. UCR will attempt to upgrade for you.
  YOU ARE ADVISED TO BACK UP YOUR UCR.INI BEFORE RUNNING THIS VERSION.
+ Adds new "Profile Inherits Plugins from parent" option to profiles.
  There is a new checkbox in the Profile Toolbox to turn this on or off for the current profile.
  If this option is on for a given profile, then when the profile is active...
  ... the profile's parent profile (if it has one) will also be active.
  This is useful when doing "Shift States", as it removes the need to duplicate plugins...
  ...in the "normal" and "shifted" profiles for things that don't change when shift is held.
= The Profile Switcher plugin now allows you to pick a profile for press and release.
  This was needed because two plugins in the same profile cannot be bound to the same button...
  ... so two profile pickers (one for press, one for release) bound tot he same button didn't work.
= Bindings to Mouse Wheel now properly simulate the up (release) event.
  Without this, if you remap mouse wheel to a key, that key is never released
= You can now control multiple vJoy sticks properly.
  Previously, UCR would only control one stick at a time, resulting in weird behaviour.
+ All pop-up windows / dialogs now appear in the center of the GUI.
= Numpad Enter is now bindable

0.0.13 - 21st May 2016
! INI (Settings) file format changed to 0.0.4. UCR will attempt to upgrade for you.
  YOU ARE ADVISED TO BACK UP YOUR UCR.INI BEFORE RUNNING THIS VERSION.
  If you have problems, please post on the forums.
= Plugins are now uniquely identified by IDs.
  This does not affect anything now, but it is an enabler for future features.
  eg: Renaming of plugins, moving plugins between profiles, inter-plugin communication.
= All IDs (Profile and Plugin) are now GUIDs generated via windows APIs
+ Status of Input Threads is now show in the Profile Toolbox.
  Blue = current profile, Green = active (eg global), Amber = Loaded but paused
= Fixes to logic for loading / unloading of Input Threads
= Up event for joystick buttons should now properly trigger...
  ... when entering a profile with the button already held.
+ UCR should now wait until done saving if you close the GUI mid-save.
+ Profile Toolbox now has a title in the GUI

0.0.12 - 17th May 2016
+ The Profile Toolbox is now integrated into the rest of the UI
  The UI is now resizable horizontally, so you can resize the profile toolbox.

0.0.11 - 10th May 2016
= The following keyboard keys are now bindable as inputs / outputs:
  PgUp, PgDn, End, Home, Left, Up, Right, Down, Insert, Delete
  Please note that some of your existingly configured bindings may change.
  eg Any binding set to NumpadLeft will now be Left arrow.
  This can be fixed by simply re-binding.

0.0.10 - 4th May 2016
+ The ProfileSwitcher plugin now has a "Press/Release" option.
  This controls whether the profile switch happens on press or release of the button.
  You can use this to switch to another profile when you press a button...
  ... then switch back to the original profile when you release the button.

0.0.9 - 3rd May 2016
= Fixed Issue #83
  The up event for a joystick button did not fire while a subsequently held button...
  ... was down, until you released the button.
  eg Hold button A, then B. Up event for A would not fire until B was released.
= Fixed Issue #84
  Output buttons were registering as Input buttons.

0.0.8 - 1st May 2016
+ Added memory management for profile Input Threads
  The "Input Threads" which handle detection of input (one for each profile)...
  ... now start and stop dynamically as profiles change.
  This is to limit the amount of memory UCR uses to a reasonable level.
  A Profile's Input Thread will now be unloaded on profile change if they are a ...
  ... "Linked Profile" of the new profile or the global profile.
  Profile A is considered a "Linked Profile" of Profile B if eg...
  ... a Profile Switcher plugin in Profile B is configured to point to Profile A.
  Plugins can call UpdateLinkedProfiles() on the parent Profile...
  ... to set their relationship to other Profiles (Add or remove a link).
= All debug output now prefixed with UCR|
  So if using DebugView, you can just filter for only UCR stuff using the string:
  DBGVIEWCLEAR;UCR|*

0.0.7 - 13th Mar 2016
! Warning! Settings version has changed.
  BACK UP your INI file before using it with this version, if you value it.
+ Profiles are now organized in a Tree instead of a flat list.
+ Added a "Profile Toolbox" to allow navigation of the profile tree.
  Add / Add Child / Delete / Rename of profiles are all functional.
  Dragging and dropping of items in the Profile Tree to change parenting or order is supported.
+ Profile Switcher plugin now has a "picker" that can be used to choose a profile from the tree.
  If you later change the structure of the tree, it will still point to the same profile.
! Both the "Profile Toolbox" and the "Profile Picker" are experimental / placeholder.
  The Profile Picker does not close unless you pick an item or close it.
  Neither remember position or size.
= Multiple AxisMerge plugins can now be used together.

0.0.6 - 21st Feb 2016
= Fixed errors while switching profile at the same time as input was happening.
  The ProfileSwitcher plugin should no longer crash UCR.

0.0.5 - 25th Jan 2016
= On change of profile, all held buttons are released.
= AxisToButton plugins now correctly manipulate the outputs.
= Multiple AxisToButton plugins now work together.

0.0.4 - 24th Jan 2016
+ Profile Switcher plugin added to allow changing profile using a hotkey.
  This can be placed in the global profile to always be in effect.
+ Basic Joystick Axis to Button remapper plugin added.
+ Settings file is now written after one second's inactivity, rather than on every change.
+ Fix for Gui getting "Lost" when you minimized it.
  If this happened to you, edit your INI file and reset the x and y coordinates at the top to 0.
+ vJoy API calls optimized.
= State property added to Output GuiControls, to match input GuiControls.
= AHK_H version updated
= Objects which are used in multiple threads are shared via COM using new AHK_H function ObjShare().


0.0.3 - 3rd Jan 2016
! WARNING: The Mouse To Joystick plugin is DANGEROUS in this version.
  Adding one can be tricky (You will have to use keyboard to manipulate the Output Axis Combos)...
  ... But once you have added one, it will effectively break UCR - crashes all over the place :(
  You will also not be able to remove the plugin via the GUI.
= AHK_H version updated
= Mouse Delta input now fires InputEvent like the other inputs
= InputEvent callbacks are now "Critical Objects".
  Input from the global profile at the same time as the active profile should no longer crash UCR.
= Spamming button inputs quickly should no longer result in a "MaxHotkeysPerInterval" warning.
= Fix for current profile being forgotten on exit.
= Fix for multiple AxisToAxis plugins all using same output.

0.0.2 - 31st Dec 2015
= AHK_H version updated
+ Button To Axis remapper plugin added. Allows mapping of WSAD to vJoy
+ MouseDelta library added for reading of Delta Move information from mice.
+ Mouse to Joystick remapper plugin added for controlling a vJoy stick using mouse.
= Fix for: Leak of memory on each input event (eg button down/up, axis move).
= When in Bind Mode, only joystick buttons and hats that actually exist are polled.
  This is better practice, and also seems to solve crashes on some systems.
= Split plugins folder into Core and User folders.
  This should allow easier upgrading if you have your own plugins.
* If upgrading, it is advised that you back up your INI file and delete the old folder.

0.0.1 - 25th Dec 2015
+ First versioned release
