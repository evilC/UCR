Plugin _OnInactive can no longer release held buttons

vXBox / vJoy do not relinquish on change of DeviceID

Profile Inheritance option not always showing in Profile Toolbox
Try adding menus to profiles and putting option in there?

Custom Serializers / Deserializers for IOClasses? Would also reduce INI file spam

Joystick button bindings need to be turned off for outputbuttons
When suspend, off happens, these become active even though they are not wanted.
Non-fatal as the bind handler does not accept them
Just add filter? Check if return type is not in mappings, and if so, do not fire callback

Remove _InputHandler?

Add Titan API back in
Deferring until I know if it is possible to set stick type (eg XBox, PS) via the API

Take a look at encoding of hat directions.
ATM, input is AHK Joy only, so only 1 hat, so Binding[1] can hold hat direction
for multi-hat IOClasses (eg vGen), this is currently encoded as (HatNum * 100) + Dir (eg 101, 201, 301, 401 for North of each 4 hats).
This requires some processing at run-time that could maybe be avoided by adding an extra property to that IOClass
Move Hat# to BindOptions?

IsEmptyAssoc in Plugin not working? GuiControls always in INI even if empty
