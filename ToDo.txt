BindOption checks in InputButton menus not working

Helper funcs (eg IsEmptyAssoc, CreateGUID) to includes

Custom Serializers / Deserializers for IOClasses? Would also reduce INI file spam

Fix BindMode thread not being passed IOClassMappings

Convert BindMode Thread to use ThreadHeader

Standard methods eg .IsBound() for IOClasses

Remove _InputHandler?

Add Titan API back in

Not relinquishing when switching from vXBox to vJoy

Take a look at encoding of hat directions.
ATM, input is AHK Joy only, so only 1 hat, so Binding[1] can hold hat direction
for multi-hat IOClasses (eg vGen), this is currently encoded as (HatNum * 100) + Dir (eg 101, 201, 301, 401 for North of each 4 hats).
This requires some processing at run-time that could maybe be avoided by adding an extra property to that IOClass
