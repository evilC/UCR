Plugin _OnInactive can no longer release held buttons

Custom Serializers / Deserializers for IOClasses? Would also reduce INI file spam

Joystick button bindings need to be turned off for outputbuttons
When suspend, off happens, these become active even though they are not wanted.
Non-fatal as the bind handler does not accept them

Convert BindMode Thread to use ThreadHeader

Standard methods eg .IsBound() for IOClasses

Remove _InputHandler?

Add Titan API back in

Take a look at encoding of hat directions.
ATM, input is AHK Joy only, so only 1 hat, so Binding[1] can hold hat direction
for multi-hat IOClasses (eg vGen), this is currently encoded as (HatNum * 100) + Dir (eg 101, 201, 301, 401 for North of each 4 hats).
This requires some processing at run-time that could maybe be avoided by adding an extra property to that IOClass
Move Hat# to BindOptions?
